## About the Video Course
Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a bundled remote computing service that provides cloud computing infrastructure over the Internet with storage, bandwidth, and customized support for application programming interfaces (API). Implementing these services to efficiently administer your cloud environments is a core task.

This video course will help you build and administer your cloud environment with AWS. We’ll begin with the AWS fundamentals, and you’ll build the foundation for the videos you’ll work on throughout the course. Next, you will find out how to manage multiple accounts and set up consolidated billing. You’ll then learn to set up reliable and fast hosting for static websites, share data between running instances and back up your data for compliance. 

Moving on, you’ll find out how to use the computer service to enable consistent and fast instance provisioning, and will see how to provision storage volumes and auto-scale an application server. Next, you’ll discover how to effectively use the networking and database service of AWS. You’ll also learn about the different management tools of AWS along with securing your AWS cloud. Finally, you will learn to estimate the costs for your cloud. By the end of the course, you’ll be able to easily administer your AWS cloud.
